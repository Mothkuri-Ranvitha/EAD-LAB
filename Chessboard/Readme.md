# Chessboard with Visible Pieces

This is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project that renders a chessboard with all chess pieces placed in their standard starting positions. The pieces are displayed using Unicode chess symbols, and visibility is improved with text outlines when a piece's color matches the square color.

## Features
- 8x8 chessboard using CSS Grid.
- Unicode chess pieces for easy display.
- White and black pieces placed in correct starting positions.
- Automatic text-outline for pieces that blend with square colors (e.g., white piece on a white square).
